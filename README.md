## r/meta-bot

This project identifies the underlying structures of the reddit community in order to deduce the interaction patterns amongst various subreddits. In order to achieve this purpose, we crafted our own set of features from the comments posted on the subreddits and clustered them into “meta-reddits” using topic modeling and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding ( t-SNE). A meta-reddit can be defined as a group of similar subreddits. Furthermore, in order to analyze the community behaviour, we collected statistics and deduced some interesting patterns between various reddit features.
